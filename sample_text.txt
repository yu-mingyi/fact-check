Uruguay will play Colombia in the Copa América semi-final after beating Brazil 4-2 on penalties at the end of a bruising 0-0 draw.
Sergio Rochet saved Brazil’s first penalty in the shootout from Éder Militão while his teammate Douglas Luiz hit the post. Brazil keeper Alisson Becker denied José Giménez but Manuel Ugarte buried the decisive spot kick.
In a bruising encounter with 41 fouls from both teams, Uruguay’s Darwin Núñez had the best chance when he missed a close-range header while Brazil’s Raphinha saw his effort on a counter-attack thwarted by Rochet.
Uruguay were down to 10 men in the second half when Nahitan Nandez was sent off following a VAR review for a crunching tackle on Rodrygo, but Brazil could not make the advantage count as Uruguay shut shop to take the match to penalties.
In Saturday’s other quarter-final, James Rodriguez scored one and made two as dismantled Panama 5-0 in Arizona. Jhon Córdoba, Luis Diaz, Richard Rios and Miguel Borja were the other scorers.
